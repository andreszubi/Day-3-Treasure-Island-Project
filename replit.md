# Treasure Island Project

## Overview
A text-based adventure game written in Python where players navigate through a treasure hunt by making choices at different decision points. This is a console-based interactive game with ASCII art.

## Project Type
Terminal User Interface (TUI) - Console Application

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.11
- **Type**: Interactive text-based adventure game
- **Dependencies**: None (uses only Python standard library)

## Project Structure
```
.
├── Treasure-Island-Project.py  # Main game file with interactive story logic
├── README.MD                    # Project documentation
└── replit.md                    # Project memory and configuration
```

## How It Works
The game presents players with a series of choices:
1. Start at a crossroad (left or right)
2. If left: encounter a lake (swim or wait for boat)
3. If wait: reach a house with three colored doors (red, yellow, or blue)
4. Only the correct path leads to treasure!

## Development Setup
- **Runtime**: Python 3.11
- **Workflow**: Runs `python Treasure-Island-Project.py` as a console application
- **Output**: Console-based text interface
